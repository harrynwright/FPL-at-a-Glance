FPL at a Glance: Your Lazy Manager's CheatÂ Sheet


Recognizing the time constraints that many Fantasy Premier League (FPL) enthusiasts face, I set out to create a tool that simplifies the decision-making process for strategic team management.
The result is a Google Data Studio dashboard that connects to a Kaggle dataset through a daily scheduled API update. This approach provides easily accessible and actionable insights.
The primary goal? To help fellow fantasy football enthusiasts with a user-friendly tool that cuts through the complexities of data analysis, offering a streamlined solution for making informed transfer decisions without the need to navigate the buggy official FPL app/website.
This dashboard is currently a work in progress. Due to the nature of the automated data updates, it presently allows for the visualization of raw data only. I am actively working on devising a solution to enhance the dashboard by incorporating additional insights that would prove invaluable to FPL managers.
